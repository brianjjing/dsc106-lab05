      <h3>POWERCOACH - Powerlifting Form Correction App</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2024-08">August 2024</time> - Present</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a Flask-SocketIO backend for an AI mobile app that provides real-time powerlifting critique for 15 barbell exercises, with the service deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service.</li>
        <li>Built an intuitive Swift frontend that audiovisually presents backend form correction feedback, with user-created workout plans and profile data managed using PostgreSQL on AWS.</li>
        <li>Trained a custom barbell detection model on over 15,000 scraped images using Google's MediaPipe object detection API, achieving an average true bounding box overlap of 0.5 on individual frames.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>BFRB Gesture Classifier</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2024-06">June 2024</time> - <time datetime="2024-07">July 2024</time></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineered a PyTorch neural network + XGBoost pipeline to classify body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) based on wrist-worn sensor data, achieving an 84% F1 testing score through 5-fold cross validation.</li>
        <li>Performed multivariate imputation on over 30,000 missing data entries within a 500,000-entry dataset using scikit-learn, optimizing imputation hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization.</li>
        <li>Boosted model training efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy by reducing 300 of the dataset's redundant raw sensor variables to 25 extracted statistical features.</li>
      </ul>
